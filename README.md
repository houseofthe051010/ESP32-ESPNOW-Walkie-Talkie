# ESP32 ESP-NOW Walkie Talkies

Custom ESP32 walkie talkies built into 3D-printed casings with I2S audio hardware, OLED screens, reclaimed lithium batteries, external antennas, and custom ESP-IDF firmware. This repository is intended to include everything needed to study, modify, rebuild, and improve the project: firmware, wiring documentation, bill of materials, photos, and CAD/enclosure files.

The folder [`Walkie Talkie CAD files`](Walkie%20Talkie%20CAD%20files/) is reserved for enclosure models, printable parts, brackets, mounts, and future case revisions, so other builders can reproduce or remix the physical design.

## Project Overview

This is the second major version of a custom digital walkie-talkie system. The radios communicate directly with each other using ESP-NOW instead of a Wi-Fi router, and the firmware is written in C with Espressif ESP-IDF so it can run much faster and more predictably than the original MicroPython prototype.

The current build uses an ESP32-U style board with an external antenna, a small OLED display, an I2S microphone, an I2S speaker amplifier, a potentiometer for volume, hardware buttons, a laser, and an LED. The goal is a compact two-way voice communicator with a phone-like interface, channel selection, link status, battery monitoring, lights controls, and experimental long-range ESP-NOW audio.

### Highlights

- Direct peer-to-peer ESP-NOW voice communication with no router or access point required.
- External antenna ESP32 hardware for improved range compared with PCB antenna modules.
- Long-range ESP-NOW radio configuration with maximum requested ESP32 transmit power and ESP32 LR PHY peer rate settings.
- Designed for up to about 1 mile line-of-sight range under ideal outdoor conditions, with real range depending heavily on antenna placement, interference, obstacles, body blocking, and battery voltage.
- 16 kHz mono voice capture with IMA ADPCM compression so each 20 ms audio frame fits in one ESP-NOW packet.
- Jitter buffering and packet-loss concealment to make received voice less choppy when packets arrive unevenly.
- Adaptive weak-link redundancy that sends duplicate audio packets when range gets rough, then de-duplicates them on receive.
- Onboard flash range logging with JSON telemetry, so range tests can be recorded without a computer connected in the field.
- OLED interface with channel, link, signal meter, battery, volume, RX/PTT indicators, app menu, settings, lights controls, and kid mode.
- Separate black and grey walkie profiles because the two physical builds have slightly different GPIO wiring.
- Firmware, wiring notes, build photos, and CAD documentation organized so the project can be forked, improved, and rebuilt.

## More Than a Walkie Talkie

Even though the main feature is voice communication, this project is also a handheld ESP32 Wi-Fi controller platform. Because each unit has buttons, a display, audio, battery power, ESP-NOW, and normal Wi-Fi capability, the same hardware can be reused to control other Wi-Fi or IoT projects.

The firmware now includes an `RCAR` app for controlling an RC/tank-style drivetrain. The black walkie can drive two MG996-style continuous-rotation servos from GPIO1/GPIO3, while the grey walkie can act as the handheld controller over ESP-NOW. The walkie casing becomes more like a rugged handheld controller with a built-in voice channel.

## Walkie Talkie Components

The project uses a custom 3D-printed walkie-talkie casing built around an ESP32-based digital audio system.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Assets/readme/grey-walkie-only.jpg" alt="Grey ESP32 walkie talkie" width="420">
  <img src="Assets/readme/black-walkie-only.jpg" alt="Black ESP32 walkie talkie" width="420">
</p>

### Main Electronics

- ESP32-U class development board with 240 MHz CPU, 4 MB flash, about 512 KB internal SRAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth hardware, and an external antenna connector.
- SSD1306-style OLED display for the full GUI.
- I2S digital microphone for voice input.
- I2S speaker output feeding a MAX9875A-style speaker amplifier.
- Small speaker inside the 3D-printed casing.
- Potentiometer for analog volume control.
- Reclaimed 3.85 V nominal lithium battery pack rated around 2000 mAh.
- Six GPIO push buttons for PTT, OK/select, navigation, back, and apps/settings.
- LED used as a transmit/status/light output.
- 3.3 V laser module used as a manual output and as part of the lights app.
- Voltage divider into an ADC pin for battery measurement.

Important battery note: the prototype batteries were found in a discarded vape on the ground and reused for this build. That is part of the project history, but it is not a safety recommendation. If you build your own, use a known-good lithium cell with a protection circuit, proper charging hardware, insulation, strain relief, and a safe enclosure. Do not reuse unknown, punctured, swollen, or damaged lithium cells.

| --- | ---: | --- |
| OLED SCL | GPIO18 | I2C clock |
| OLED SDA | GPIO19 | I2C data |
| Speaker BCLK | GPIO32 | I2S output bit clock |
| Speaker WS/LRC | GPIO33 | I2S output word select |
| Speaker DIN | GPIO25 | I2S output data |

| Volume potentiometer | GPIO34 | ADC input |
| Battery divider | GPIO35 | ADC input |

### Black and Grey Variant Pinout

The two walkies are not wired exactly the same, so the firmware has board profiles in `menuconfig`.

| Function | Black walkie | Grey walkie |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| PTT button | GPIO22 | GPIO23 |
| LED output | GPIO23 | GPIO22 |
| Top-left button | GPIO26 | GPIO2 |
| Top-right button | GPIO2 | GPIO26 |
| Battery divider | 100k / 100k | 220k / 220k |
| Default peer | Grey MAC | Black MAC |

Default ESP-NOW peer MAC addresses:

- Black walkie: `A4:F0:0F:66:D2:D0`
- Grey walkie: `A4:F0:0F:67:BA:1C`

### RC Car Expansion Pins

The black walkie exposes GPIO1 and GPIO3 for the `RCAR` app:

| RC car signal | Black walkie GPIO | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Left drivetrain servo signal | GPIO1 / UART0 TX | 50 Hz PWM signal in `RCAR` mode |
| Right drivetrain servo signal | GPIO3 / UART0 RX | 50 Hz PWM signal in `RCAR` mode |

GPIO1/GPIO3 are UART0 pins, so they are only taken over by PWM when the `RCAR` app is active. They are signal pins only; do not power MG996 servos from the ESP32 3.3 V pin. Use a separate 5 to 6 V servo supply capable of the motor current, and connect the servo ground to the walkie/ESP32 ground.

## Internal Build: Grey Walkie

<p align="center">
  <img src="Assets/readme/grey-walkie-internal.jpg" alt="Grey walkie internal circuitry" width="900">
</p>

The grey walkie is the second iteration. Its internal wiring and soldering are much cleaner, with thinner wires used between modules. That makes the inside less congested, easier to inspect, and easier to debug. Compared with the first build, the grey unit has a more intentional layout and less mechanical stress on the small solder joints.

The cleaner wiring also matters for audio. Digital microphones, I2S speaker signals, and ESP32 Wi-Fi bursts can all become annoying to debug when power, ground, and signal wiring are crowded together. Keeping the second iteration cleaner made it easier to isolate software audio problems from wiring problems.

## Internal Build: Black Walkie

<p align="center">
  <img src="Assets/readme/black-walkie-internal.jpg" alt="Black walkie internal circuitry" width="900">
</p>

The black walkie is the first ESP32 iteration. It works, but the internal wiring uses much thicker wires and is more congested inside the casing. This made the build harder to close, harder to inspect, and harder to modify later.

The black unit also revealed why the firmware needs board profiles. Its PTT and LED pins are swapped compared with the grey unit, and the top-left/top-right buttons are swapped too. Instead of rewiring both units to be identical, the firmware supports both physical layouts.

## Project History

This walkie-talkie design took multiple iterations before reaching the current ESP32 ESP-IDF version.

The first approach used a Raspberry Pi Pico with an NRF24L01 radio module. That was useful for learning, but it became difficult for real voice audio. The Pico does not have the same straightforward I2S peripheral setup as the ESP32 for this project, and using PIO to implement I2S was too difficult and time-consuming for this build. NRF24L01 audio transport also would have required more custom protocol work.

The project then moved to an ESP32 with an external antenna. That change helped a lot because ESP32 has strong documentation, built-in Wi-Fi radio hardware, ESP-NOW support, mature ESP-IDF tooling, and standard I2S peripherals for both microphone input and speaker output. Moving from MicroPython to compiled ESP-IDF firmware also made the system faster and gave more control over timing, buffering, compression, and GPIO behavior.

## Range Resilience and Field Diagnostics

The firmware is built to be tested outdoors, not just on a desk. When the walkies get far enough apart that packets start dropping, the radio layer can automatically send one duplicate copy of each audio frame. Both copies use the same sequence number, so the receiver plays whichever copy arrives first and ignores the duplicate instead of stuttering.

The receiver also tracks missing sequence numbers. Very short gaps are filled with packet-loss concealment audio so the speaker fades through the missing frame instead of clicking or abruptly cutting out. Longer fades still sound bad, but the onboard log makes them measurable instead of mysterious.

Every second, the walkie records a compact JSON telemetry line with RSSI, link quality, jitter-buffer depth, duplicate packets, missing-packet concealment, send failures, and wrong-channel/peer rejects. These lines are printed over USB when connected and saved to onboard flash when the walkie is out in the field. After a range test, hold `PTT + bottom-left` during startup to dump the stored `range.jsonl` data over serial.

## Firmware Features

The firmware is an ESP-IDF project designed for the Espressif VS Code extension and command-line `idf.py`.

### Firmware Showcase

The firmware turns the 3D-printed handheld into more than a simple radio. It is a menu-driven ESP32 device with voice, controls, telemetry, lights, and room for future Wi-Fi apps.

Current firmware version: `0.5.4`.

Current firmware features:

- 20 logical walkie-talkie channels, selected from the main PTT screen.
- Push-to-talk ESP-NOW voice mode with channel-matched audio packets.
- Link detection with heartbeat packets and an RSSI-based signal meter.
- Adaptive weak-link redundancy that sends an extra copy of each audio frame when the link quality is low or unknown.
- Six physical push buttons per walkie: PTT, OK/select, top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
- Apps menu with `RCAR`, `BUTTON CTRL`, `LIGHTS`, and `KID MODE`.
- `RCAR` app with black-walkie Web Server mode and grey-to-black Walkie controller mode.
- Settings menu for audio limiting, low-battery limiting, speaker boost, mic boost, mic cut, flash usage, memory usage, and CPU overlay.
- Settings rows for firmware version display and onboard log dumping.
- Light playground for experimenting with the LED and 3.3 V laser module through strobe, target, rate, constant-on, and preset pattern modes.
- Kid mode that locks the device to one channel until OK is held for 2 seconds.

Planned or experimental firmware ideas:

- Wi-Fi talk mode where a walkie can connect to a normal Wi-Fi network instead of only peer-to-peer ESP-NOW.
- TX-to-computer mode for sending microphone audio or control packets from the walkie to a computer.
- RX-from-computer mode for receiving audio, commands, or messages from a computer and playing/showing them on the walkie.
- More IoT control modes for lights, robots, sensors, and other ESP32 projects.

### User Interface

- Main PTT screen with device name, battery icon, voltage, channel number, link state, volume, laser state, signal meter, RX activity, and PTT activity.
- Channel display formatted as `< CH XX >` to show that top-left/top-right can change through the 20 logical channels.
- Apps menu with only functional apps: `RCAR`, `BUTTON CTRL`, `LIGHTS`, and `KID MODE`.
- `RCAR` menu with `WEB SERVER` and `WALKIE` modes. Web Server mode starts an open Wi-Fi AP named `ESP32-Tank` on the black walkie and serves a joystick page at `http://192.168.4.1`. Walkie mode lets the grey walkie control the black walkie's left/right servos over ESP-NOW.
- Settings page with audio limiting, low-battery limiting, speaker boost, mic boost, mic cut, flash usage, memory usage, CPU overlay, firmware version, and log dump.
- Lights app/light playground with strobe, target selection, rate, constant LED, constant 3.3 V laser, and preset patterns.
- Kid mode locked to channel 1, with OK held for 2 seconds to exit.

### Radio and Link System

- Uses ESP-NOW for peer-to-peer packets.
- Uses a logical channel number from 1 to 20 inside every packet.
- Uses RF channel from ESP-IDF config, currently defaulting to channel 6.
- Sends heartbeat packets so the UI can show `LINK ON` or `LINK OFF`.
- Reads RSSI from received ESP-NOW metadata when available.
- Smooths RSSI into a signal-quality percentage for the left-side signal meter.
- Sends duplicate audio packets with the same sequence number when the link is weak, giving the receiver a second chance to receive a frame before playback needs it.
- De-duplicates repeated sequence numbers on receive so redundancy does not play the same 20 ms audio frame twice.
- Requests maximum ESP32 Wi-Fi transmit power with `esp_wifi_set_max_tx_power(84)`.
- Disables Wi-Fi power saving for more consistent latency.
- Configures the ESP-NOW peer for ESP32 long-range PHY rate when supported by the IDF and hardware.

### Range Debug Logging

The firmware creates one JSON-line telemetry record per second. Each record is printed over USB serial when connected and also saved into an onboard flash log, so the walkie can collect range-test data while it is far away from the computer.

The onboard log lives in a dedicated `fieldlog` SPIFFS partition. It stores `range.jsonl` plus one rotated previous file, giving roughly 512 KB of flash-backed range telemetry storage. The firmware rotates the current file before it fills the partition.

Example record:

```json
{"event":"radio_stats","t_ms":123456,"board":"BLACK","ch":1,"ptt":false,"link":true,"rssi_dbm":-82,"quality_pct":21,"jitter_frames":3,"vol_pct":50,"tx_audio":0,"tx_audio_dup":0,"tx_ctrl":2,"tx_no_mem":0,"tx_fail":0,"rx_audio":48,"rx_audio_dup":7,"rx_audio_old":0,"rx_plc":2,"rx_ctrl":1,"rx_wrong_peer":0,"rx_bad_proto":0,"rx_wrong_channel":0}
```

Useful fields:

- `rssi_dbm` and `quality_pct` show how strong the peer signal is.
- `jitter_frames` shows how many decoded frames are waiting for speaker playback.
- `tx_audio_dup` shows how many redundant audio packets were sent.
- `rx_audio_dup` shows duplicate packets that were received and safely ignored.
- `rx_plc` shows how many packet-loss concealment frames were generated because audio packets were still missing.
- `tx_no_mem` and `tx_fail` show whether ESP-NOW had trouble queueing or sending packets.
- `rx_wrong_channel`, `rx_bad_proto`, and `rx_wrong_peer` help diagnose configuration or interference problems.

To capture live serial logs when a computer is connected:

```powershell
idf.py -p COM6 monitor | Tee-Object range-test.jsonl
```

To dump the onboard flash log later:

1. Connect the walkie to USB.
2. Hold `PTT` and `bottom-left`.
3. Reset or power-cycle the walkie while still holding those two buttons.
4. Open the serial monitor and save the output.

The dump begins with `field_log_dump_begin`, prints the stored `radio_stats` JSON lines, and ends with `field_log_dump_end`. The OK button is intentionally not used for the boot gesture because OK is on GPIO0, which is also an ESP32 boot strap pin.

You can also dump logs while the firmware is already running:

1. Connect the walkie to USB serial.
2. Open `APPS` then `SETTINGS`.
3. Scroll to `DUMP LOGS`.
4. Press `OK`; the firmware prints the stored log immediately over serial.

The `FW VERSION` settings row shows the currently flashed firmware version, currently `V0.5.4`.

Both walkies should run firmware with the de-duplication logic before testing weak-link redundancy. If only one unit is updated, the older receiver may treat duplicate audio packets as real repeated audio.

### Audio Transport

Audio is sent as compressed voice frames over ESP-NOW.

- Microphone sample rate: 16 kHz mono.
- Frame duration: 20 ms.
- Samples per frame: 320.
- Compression: IMA ADPCM at 4 bits per sample.
- Audio payload per frame: 160 bytes.
- One audio frame is sent in one ESP-NOW packet.
- Packet rate while PTT is held: 50 audio packets per second.
- Packed audio packet size: 171 bytes.

Audio packet fields:

| Field | Size | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Packet type | 1 byte | `0xA1` for audio |
| Protocol version | 1 byte | Firmware protocol version |
| Logical channel | 1 byte | 1 to 20 software channel |
| Flags | 1 byte | Kid-mode/audio flags |
| Sequence number | 2 bytes | Detects ordering and loss |
| ADPCM predictor | 2 bytes | Decoder state for the frame |
| ADPCM step index | 1 byte | Decoder step size state |
| Sample count | 2 bytes | Usually 320 |
| ADPCM payload | 160 bytes | Compressed voice samples |

Control packet types:

| Packet | Value | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Audio | `0xA1` | Compressed voice |
| Heartbeat | `0xB1` | Link detection |
| Scan request | `0xB2` | Channel scan |
| Scan response | `0xB3` | Channel scan reply |

### Audio Cleanup

The firmware includes several processing steps to make ESP-NOW voice more understandable:

- I2S microphone capture uses the left channel because the microphone L/R pin is tied to ground.
- A mic warmup discards the first frames after PTT starts so the beginning of a transmission is less noisy.
- A high-pass filter reduces DC offset and low-frequency rumble.
- Noise-floor tracking helps distinguish quiet background from voice.
- Gentle speech gating reduces background noise without fully chopping quiet speech.
- Per-board mic gain profiles compensate for the black and grey builds having different real-world microphone behavior.
- Speaker boost and mic boost settings adjust fixed-point gain in the firmware.
- A receive jitter buffer smooths packet arrival timing.
- Packet-loss concealment fills short gaps so missed packets sound less harsh.

## Code Structure

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `main/main.c` | Main application state, board selection, GPIO, ADC, ESP-NOW, I2S setup, RC car PWM/web/control mode, FreeRTOS tasks, buttons, menus, lights, heartbeat, scan, capture, playback, and resource stats |
| `main/walkie_audio.c` | Microphone cleanup, gain, ADPCM encode/decode, playback scaling, and packet-loss concealment helpers |
| `main/walkie_audio.h` | Audio API shared with the main application |
| `main/walkie_display.c` | SSD1306 OLED driver, framebuffer drawing, fonts, and all UI screens |
| `main/walkie_display.h` | Display API |
| `main/walkie_types.h` | Shared board, UI, RC car, settings, lights, and snapshot structures |
| `main/Kconfig.projbuild` | Menuconfig options for black/grey board profiles, MAC addresses, and RF channel |
| `partitions.csv` | Custom ESP-IDF partition table with the app partition and 512 KB onboard `fieldlog` SPIFFS log storage |
| `sdkconfig.defaults` | Default ESP-IDF project settings |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | Top-level ESP-IDF project definition |

## Runtime Tasks

The firmware is split into a few FreeRTOS tasks:

- `control_task` reads buttons, updates menus, smooths volume/battery readings, sends heartbeats, updates outputs, and redraws the OLED.
- `capture_task` runs while PTT is pressed, reads the I2S microphone, processes voice, compresses it, and sends ESP-NOW audio frames.
- `radio_task` receives ESP-NOW packets from the callback queue and routes heartbeats, scans, and audio frames.
- `playback_task` drains the receive jitter buffer and writes decoded audio to the I2S speaker path.

This split keeps the UI responsive while audio and radio work continue in the background.

## Build and Flash

Open the folder in VS Code with the Espressif IDF extension, or use the ESP-IDF command line.

### Configure the board

Run:

```powershell
idf.py menuconfig
```

Then open:

```text
Walkie Talkie Configuration
```

Choose either:

- `Black walkie`
- `Grey walkie`

This selects the correct PTT, LED, top-left, top-right, battery smoothing, mic gain, and peer MAC behavior.

### Build

```powershell
idf.py build
```

### Flash

Replace `COM6` with your actual serial port:

```powershell
idf.py -p COM6 flash monitor
```

On this Windows setup, the Espressif environment can also be loaded with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -Command "& { . 'C:\Espressif\tools\Microsoft.662a3be.PowerShell_profile.ps1'; idf.py -p COM6 flash monitor }"
```

## Resource Usage

The firmware targets the ESP32 at 240 MHz with 4 MB flash. A recent build of this project used approximately:

| Resource | Approximate usage |
| --- | ---: |
| Firmware app image | 917 KiB |
| App partition used | 61 percent |
| App partition free | 583 KiB |
| Flash code | 686 KB |
| Flash data | 144 KB |
| Static DRAM | 45 KB |
| Static DRAM remaining | 136 KB |
| IRAM | 90 KB |
| IRAM remaining | 41 KB |

Most of the flash usage comes from ESP-IDF Wi-Fi, ESP-NOW, HTTP server, networking, and support libraries, not from the walkie application code itself.

The CPU runs at a fixed 240 MHz in the current configuration because dynamic power management is disabled. The CPU percentage shown in the UI is a firmware activity/debug indicator, not a clock-speed readout.

## Power Usage and Battery Life

The prototype battery is a 3.85 V nominal high-capacity lithium cell rated around 2000 mAh. Actual runtime depends on volume, transmit duty cycle, LED/laser use, Wi-Fi conditions, battery health, regulator efficiency, and speaker loudness.

Estimated current draw:

| Mode | Estimated current |
| --- | ---: |
| Idle/listening, OLED on, no audio | 125 to 175 mA |
| Receiving voice at about 50 percent volume | 180 to 270 mA |
| PTT transmit with LED on, no speaker playback | 180 to 280 mA |
| Busy worst case with RX audio, LED, laser, and high Wi-Fi activity | 250 to 400 mA or more |
| RC car mode, excluding servo motor power | Similar to Wi-Fi/ESP-NOW active modes |
| MG996 servo drivetrain power | Can be hundreds of mA to multiple amps depending on load/stall |

Estimated runtime from a 2000 mAh cell:

| Usage pattern | Estimate |
| --- | ---: |
| Mostly idle/listening | 11 to 16 hours |
| Mixed receive/transmit use | 7 to 10 hours |
| Heavy audio and frequent transmit | 5 to 8 hours |
| Near worst-case continuous high draw | 4 to 6 hours |

If the system uses a linear regulator from 5 V down to 3.3 V, the regulator wastes the voltage difference as heat. At 250 mA, the regulator dissipates about `(5.0 V - 3.3 V) * 0.25 A = 0.425 W`. At 350 mA, it dissipates about `0.595 W`. That can become warm in a small 3D-printed casing, so a buck regulator would be more efficient for long battery life.

Approximate subsystem draw:

- ESP32 with Wi-Fi active: about 100 to 240 mA depending on receive/transmit activity and RF power.
- OLED: roughly 10 to 25 mA depending on display content and module.
- LED: about 13 mA.
- Laser: about 3 mA.
- Speaker amplifier at 50 percent volume: roughly 50 to 90 mA average for loud voice, with higher peaks depending on speaker impedance and output level.
- MG996 drivetrain servos: power separately from a high-current 5 to 6 V rail; the walkie GPIOs provide control signals only.

## Assembly Process

Start by soldering all of the electronic components outside the walkie-talkie casing. Use wires long enough that each module can reach its final position inside the casing without pulling on the solder joints. Thin flexible wire makes the final assembly much easier, especially around the ESP32, OLED, buttons, speaker, and battery.

Before permanently placing parts, test-fit everything in the casing. The inside of the 3D-printed walkie casing is tight, so it helps to route wires before taping, gluing, or screwing modules down.

### Power Wiring

Build the battery power circuit first and verify the polarity before connecting the ESP32 or amplifier.

1. Connect the lithium battery positive and negative wires to the TP4056 battery pads.
2. Connect the TP4056 output ground to the boost converter ground.
3. Route the TP4056 output positive through the main power button or power switch.
4. Connect the output of that power button/switch to the boost converter VCC/input positive.
5. Connect the boost converter 5 V output to the ESP32 5V/VIN input and to the MAX9875A-style amplifier power input.
6. Tie the grounds together so the ESP32, amplifier, OLED, microphone, buttons, LED, laser, boost converter, and TP4056 all share a common ground.

Do not connect the boost converter 5 V output to the ESP32 `3V3` pin. Use the ESP32 board's `5V` or `VIN` input if your development board supports it. Lithium cells can be dangerous if shorted or wired incorrectly, so check the TP4056 labels carefully because different modules may label pads as `B+`, `B-`, `OUT+`, `OUT-`, `IN+`, and `IN-`.

### Physical Placement

1. Insert the TP4056 charging board into its slot first.
2. After the components are soldered, place the ESP32 underneath the charging board, next to the battery.
3. Put the six push buttons into their printed slots in the casing.
4. Place the LED next to the PTT button where the small LED hole is located.
5. Place the 3.3 V laser module in the laser hole.
6. Place the potentiometer in the potentiometer hole.
7. Make sure the external antenna is connected to the ESP32 antenna connector.
8. Route the antenna into the antenna hole to the right of the potentiometer.
9. Put the knob onto the potentiometer shaft.
10. Put the speaker into the speaker slot.
11. Put the microphone into the microphone slot.
12. Put the OLED into the OLED display slot.

Once all parts are seated, close the casing carefully while watching for pinched wires. If the case does not close easily, do not force it; open it again and reroute the thickest wire bundles first. This was one of the biggest improvements in the grey second-iteration build: thinner wires made the internals cleaner, easier to close, and easier to repair.

## Building Your Own

Because this is open source, the intended path is:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Review the circuit diagram and photos.
3. Add or modify CAD files in [`Walkie Talkie CAD files`](Walkie%20Talkie%20CAD%20files/).
4. Wire one black-style or grey-style unit, or create a new board profile.
5. Set the correct peer MAC addresses in `menuconfig`.
6. Build and flash the firmware.
7. Test audio at short range first.
8. Tune mic gain, speaker gain, channel, and antenna placement.
9. Test range outdoors with clear line of sight.

If your wiring differs, add a new board profile instead of hardcoding changes over the existing black/grey profiles. That keeps the firmware easier for other builders to understand.

## Future Work

- Continue tuning long-range ESP-NOW voice using the onboard field logs, signal meter, redundancy counters, antenna placement, and outdoor range tests.
- Expand the RC car app with finer speed steps, steering presets, and telemetry from the vehicle side.
- Expand the Wi-Fi app modes for computer audio, remote control, or IoT experiments over normal Wi-Fi networks.
- Experiment with full-duplex voice later. The ESP32 already has separate I2S microphone and speaker paths, but the radio protocol would need collision handling before both walkies can talk at the same time reliably.
- Add more functional apps only when they have real behavior, keeping the main app carousel focused instead of crowded with placeholders.
